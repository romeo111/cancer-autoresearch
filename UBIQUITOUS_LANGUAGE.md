## Relationships

- A **Patient Profile** without **Histology** produces a **DiagnosticPlan**, never a **Plan** (CHARTER §15.2 C7).
- A **Plan** belongs to exactly one **Patient** and contains one **Standard Plan** and one **Aggressive Plan**.
- A **Disease** has zero or more **Indications**; an **Indication** maps to one or more **Regimens**.
- A **Regimen** is composed of one or more **Drugs** and is justified by one or more **Sources**.
- A **RedFlag** is owned by one or more **Diseases** and cites at least two **Sources**.
- A **Source** has exactly one hosting mode: **Referenced**, **Hosted**, or **Mixed**.
- Any clinical **KB entity** change requires a **Two-Reviewer Merge** by **Clinical Co-Leads**.
- A **Provenance Event** targets a **Regimen**, **Plan Section**, or other **Plan**-internal entity, and is appended to one **Event Log**.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "If a **Patient Profile** comes in without **Histology**, what does the **Rule Engine** return?"

> **Domain expert:** "A **DiagnosticPlan** — never a **Plan**. The **Rule Engine** is in **Diagnostic Mode** in that case and lists the workup needed to confirm a **Disease**."

> **Dev:** "And once the path lab confirms, say, DLBCL — the engine flips to **Treatment Mode** and produces both a **Standard Plan** and an **Aggressive Plan**?"

> **Domain expert:** "Right. Each branch points at one or more **Regimens** chosen via the matching **Indications**, and every **Regimen** carries its **Source** citations. If a **RedFlag** trips on the profile — say HBV reactivation risk before rituximab — it surfaces alongside both branches."

> **Dev:** "When a **Clinical Co-Lead** signs off on the **Aggressive Plan**, that's a **Provenance Event** on the **Plan Section**?"

> **Domain expert:** "Yes — `event_type=approved`, `target_type=plan_section`, `target_id=TRACK-AGGRESSIVE`. It appends to the patient's **Event Log** and shows up in the **Decision Provenance Graph** when the **Plan** is re-rendered."

## Flagged ambiguities

- **"Plan"** was used for both the treatment recommendation entity and the workup recommendation. **Plan** is now reserved for treatment output; **DiagnosticPlan** is the distinct workup entity. Don't say "diagnostic plan" in lowercase prose without meaning the entity.
- **"Source"** collided with English "source code" and "source document." In the OpenOnco domain, **Source** always refers to the cited-authority KB entity. Use "source file" or "the original PDF" for other senses.
- **"MDT"** is the clinical role (Multidisciplinary Team). The repo files `MDT.png` / `MDT-light.png` are infographics about MDT — they are not themselves an MDT. Don't conflate.
- **"Reviewer"** is informal; the governance role with sign-off authority is **Clinical Co-Lead**. Reserve "reviewer" for non-binding feedback.
- **"Event"** is overloaded between **Provenance Event** (clinical action) and runtime/build events (e.g. scheduled tasks). When in doubt, prefix as **Provenance Event**.
- **"Engine"** can mean the **Rule Engine** (Python evaluator) or the **Engine Bundle** (Pyodide-loaded zip). They are the same logic in different runtime shells; disambiguate when context is unclear.
- **"Stub"** vs "draft" — use **Stub** for KB entities awaiting clinical sign-off. Don't use "draft" for clinical content; reserve "draft" for spec versioning (e.g. `v0.1 draft`).
