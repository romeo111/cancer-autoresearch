"""Tests for knowledge_base.stats — entity counters + per-disease coverage.

Verifies:
1. collect_stats walks the live KB and returns plausible counts (>0 for
   the categories we know exist: diseases, indications, regimens, drugs).
2. Per-disease coverage is populated (DIS-MM and DIS-HCV-MZL exist today
   and both have full disease→indication→regimen→algorithm chains, so
   their status is at least 'stub_full_chain').
3. Text formatter emits the expected section headers without raising.
4. JSON formatter emits valid JSON with derived coverage_status field.
5. HTML widget formatter is well-formed (single .oo-widget div, contains
   counter cards + coverage table + STUB warning when appropriate).
6. CHARTER §6.1 STUB warning fires when no entity has reviewer_signoffs ≥ 2.
