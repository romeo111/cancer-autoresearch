"""Plan entity — versioned per-patient treatment plan with multiple tracks.

A Plan is the **rendered output** of the rule engine for a specific patient
at a point in time. Per CHARTER §2, every Plan presents at least two
alternative tracks (standard, aggressive) in **one document** — easier for
tumor-board discussion, single revision history, single audit trail.

A Plan is also a **versioned, living artifact** (per the project's core
product vision): when new patient data arrives — fresh labs, doctor decision,
updated history, new imaging — a new Plan version is generated. The previous
version is retained (immutable), linked via supersedes/superseded_by.

**Privacy note:** Plan instances contain patient-specific data. They live
**outside** the public knowledge base (see CHARTER §9.3). Default location:
`patient_plans/<patient_id>/v<N>.yaml`, gitignored. Only the schema (this
file) and templates are in the public repo.

**FDA non-device CDS positioning** (CHARTER §15): the Plan output structure
is what makes OpenOnco satisfy §520(o)(1)(E) Criterion 4 — every Plan
surfaces the intended use, HCP user, patient population, algorithm summary,
data limitations, and per-track rationale + sources, so the HCP can
independently review the basis.
