"""BiomarkerActionability entity — maps (gene-variant, tumor_type) pairs to
clinical actionability tiers, anchored on ESMO ESCAT.

Each instance answers "what does this specific variant mean for treatment in
this specific cancer?" Composes existing BIO-* (gene/variant taxonomy) and
DIS-* (disease taxonomy) entities into a per-tumor clinical interpretation.

Phase 1 of the CIViC pivot (2026-04-27): the OncoKB-specific fields
`oncokb_level` and `oncokb_snapshot_version` were dropped — see
docs/reviews/oncokb-public-civic-coverage-2026-04-27.md for the ToS
audit that triggered the pivot. Per-source level information now lives
in the `evidence_sources` list, where each entry references a Source
entity (SRC-*) and carries the source-native level token.

ESCAT remains the primary actionability tier (`escat_tier`) because it
is open-license and source-neutral. CIViC, OncoKB, NCCN page-section
references, ESMO sections, etc. all become entries inside
`evidence_sources`.

Not in KNOWLEDGE_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATION yet (added 2026-04-26 for the CSD Lab
partnership pitch). When the spec is updated, register this entity there.
