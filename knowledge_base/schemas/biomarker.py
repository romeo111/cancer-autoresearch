    conservative — biomarkers without an explicit hint are SKIPPED. This
    is intentional: silent guessing of (gene, variant) from biomarker id
    risks false negatives that clinicians wouldn't notice.

    `gene` must be the HGNC symbol (uppercase). `variant` should be the
    short HGVS-p form (e.g. "V600E", "L858R", "G12C"), a structured
    descriptor (e.g. "Exon 19 deletion", "E746_A750del"), or a frameshift
    token (e.g. "W288fs"). Full HGVS validation lives in
    `engine/actionability_extract.py:normalize_variant`; this schema only
    type-checks. Anything that fails normalization at runtime (HGVS-c,
    fusion, boolean flag) should not be represented here — leave the hint
    absent and use `oncokb_skip_reason` instead.

    Source-agnostic: same hint shape feeds CIViC, OncoKB-style readers,
    or any future actionability source.
