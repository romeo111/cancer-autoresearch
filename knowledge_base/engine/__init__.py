"""OpenOnco rule engine: patient profile → applicable Indications → two plans.

No clinical reasoning happens in code — the code only **evaluates** rules
authored by clinical reviewers (CHARTER §8.3). Decisions about *which*
regimen to recommend are already encoded in the Indication / Algorithm
entities under `knowledge_base/hosted/content/`.

The MDT Orchestrator (mdt_orchestrator.py) is a separate read-only
layer: it reads a PlanResult and produces a tumor-board brief
(required roles, open questions, provenance events). It does NOT
modify the PlanResult or change clinical recommendations
(specs/MDT_ORCHESTRATOR_SPEC.md §1.2).
