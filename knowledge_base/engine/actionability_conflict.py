"""Resistance-conflict detector — safe-rollout v3 §6 (T3 mitigation).

Pure function. NO I/O. Detects when an engine-recommended drug appears
in actionability evidence flagged as "resistance" for one of the
patient's biomarkers.

Source-agnostic: the "drug X appears in resistance evidence for
biomarker Y" pattern works for any actionability source. CIViC encodes
resistance via direction=Supports & significance=Resistance; OncoKB
encodes via R1/R2 levels. Either way, the matcher only sees a
ResistanceConflict-eligible level token (matchers populate
RESISTANCE_LEVELS at lookup time).

This is the most safety-critical part of the actionability integration:
without it, a clinician scrolling top-down might miss resistance
evidence in the lower actionability section. Per CHARTER §15.2 C6
(automation-bias mitigation), conflicts must surface inline in the
track-card, not only in the actionability layer.

Wired by `generate_plan` after both `tracks` and
`actionability_layer.results` are populated. Output drives:
  - inline banner in render
  - ProvenanceEvent("resistance_conflict_detected") on the plan
  - MDT trigger: molecular_geneticist role added
